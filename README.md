# Marketing Effectiveness: A Case Study in Regression and Forecasting

## GBU 3311 04 | Fall Semester 2025-2026  
### Case Study 2: Regression and Forecasting (20% of the Total Grade)

### About the Project

This project was part of my **GBU 3311 Quantitative Methods in Business** course. The goal? To figure out which marketing channels—YouTube, Facebook, or Newspaper—really drive sales. I used regression analysis to understand how different marketing spends affect sales, and then used logistic regression to predict profitability.

### What I Did

#### Task 1: **Multiple Linear Regression**
I kicked things off by running a multiple linear regression in Excel to see how YouTube, Facebook, and Newspaper marketing spend impacted sales. Then, I took the analysis to the next level by using Python to refine the model and dig deeper into the data.

#### Task 2: **Logistic Regression**
Next, I used logistic regression to predict profitability based on the marketing spend. This model helped me understand the likelihood of a company being profitable given their budget on YouTube, Facebook, and Newspaper ads. 

### Key Takeaways

- **YouTube & Facebook are solid investments!**  
  Both of these channels had a big impact on sales, with Facebook having an even stronger effect. If a business wants more sales, investing more in these platforms makes a lot of sense.

- **Newspaper ads? Not so much.**  
  The data showed that newspaper ads didn’t significantly boost sales. So, it might be worth considering reallocating the marketing budget away from newspapers.

- **Logistic regression nailed profitability predictions.**  
  The logistic regression model had an accuracy of 88.5%, so it did a great job predicting whether the company would be profitable based on marketing spend.

### Conclusion

This project was all about using **regression analysis** and **logistic regression** to make data-driven decisions in marketing. By analyzing real marketing data, I was able to identify which channels give the best return on investment and predict profitability with solid accuracy.

### What I Used
- **Python** (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels) for all the analysis
- **Excel** for some initial work and quick checks
